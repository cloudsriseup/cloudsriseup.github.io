                    <h3>Vision enablement</h3>
                    <p>Information is the life blood of business.  The responsibility to manage and protect information assets has moved from the server room to the board room.  And many, if not most organizations, cannot afford the executive leadership needed to effectively guide their investments to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of their information assets.
Today organizations of every size are expected to:
meet complex and constantly changing security and privacy requirements from customers and partners,
comply with over 75 potentially applicable country and state privacy laws that regulate their operations,
ensure high availability, integrity and confidentiality of the information they expose to the Internet,
and, at the same time control, or in many cases reduce, information security and compliance spend.
Organizations like yours realize there are complexities that only an experienced Chief Security Officer (CSO) and/or Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) can solve.    The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is the top executive that focuses primarily on information security. The CISO serves as the business leader responsible for the development, implementation and management of the corporate security vision, strategy and programs that are balanced with the risk tolerance and the budgetary and business needs of the enterprise.</p>

                    <p>Many firms may not need, or can justify the expense of, a full-time CISO or may be looking for just the right person to feel the position. Outsourcing the CISO function permanently or sho-term goes by many names including Part time CISO, Contract CISO, CISO contractor, CISO consultant, Fractional CISO, Temporary CISO, Security Advisor, Information Security Operations Manager, and the new term Security Officer as a Service (SOaaS)</p>
