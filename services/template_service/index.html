                    <h2>Proactive</h2>
                    <p>Software security is about building software to be secure even when it is under attack. As we have learned from years network security drama, protecting software is much easier if the software is built with security in mind. Furthermore, security is a property and not a thing, so software security involves much more than simply adding security features like SSL or passwords to software.</p>
                    <p>Organizations that depend on software to work (pretty much everybody these days) need software that doesn’t leak millions of identity records, call election results into question, gin up huge legal liabilities, or allow secrets to fall into the wrong hands. The only way to make software trustworthy is to build security in.</p>

                    <h3>What happened?</h3>
                    <p> We’ve seen the same kind of need for software security justification as we saw back in the day before IT security became mainstream. Back then, there were executives who simply didn’t get why firewalls were necessary or how intrusion detection helped prevent a small issue from becoming a big one or how simply teaching people how to think about security could actually change a corporate culture. In those early days even managers who understood the problem intellectually might be sorely tempted to see just how long the firm could wait before it became their turn to be victimized.
In our clients, we’ve seen software security groups (SSGs) get their charter and funding under four broad sets of circumstances:  1.  Executive management said “We will make secure software” and funded the means to do it (e.g., the “Gates memo” at Microsoft).</ul>
2.  An established upper-management group responsible for some form of compliance determined that software security is a necessary expense in the firm’s governance processes.
3.  The IT security crew proved that a breach was not their fault, but rather a result of the firm’s applications. As a result, a software security person was appointed in the IT ranks.
4.  A charismatic software security entrepreneur (e.g., in the CIO, CTO, Legal, or governance groups) worked the system to get the ball rolling and then parleyed early successes into funding for an actual program.
It seems that the hard part these days isn’t necessarily selling upper management on the problem, but selling upper management that you’re the right person to lead the solution and that you actually have a plan. If you are “responsible” for software security in the sense that you are the person to get fired after a major software security failure and you cannot get resources for a program that will address the issues, quit now. Seriously. Life is just too short for that kind of nonsense, and there are plenty of employers willing to make real use of your abilities.</p>
