                    <h2>Tooling</h2>
                    <p>In this environment, internal audit is in the spotlight. Executives, boards, and audit committees are looking for the function to step out beyond the spreadsheet columns of financial, ethics, and IT general controls and jump into the three-dimensional chessboard of today’s IT systems, networks, threats, and opportunities. They need IA to be proactive, throwing out checklists of IT audits they think they “should” be doing and instead engaging with stakeholders across the organization to discover exactly what they need to be doing to support the company and its business objectives. Through this type of engagement, IA can develop a big-picture understanding of the strategic, operational, reporting, and compliance objectives behind the company’s IT investments, and use that understanding to drive the IT IA risk assessment, audit plan, and resource allocation.</p>

                    <h3>Value Add</h3>
                    <p>IA can deliver the greatest value to an organization when it operates within this type of strategic framework — when its mission, vision, and functional strategies are aligned with the expectations of its key stakeholders, and when its activities are linked to the most significant risks to achieving the overall business agenda. By taking a broader focus that encompasses operations, compliance, and non-financial reporting issues, and by enhancing existing IA processes through the use of data analytics, continuous auditing, real-time auditing, and other advanced approaches, IA can provide value-added services and proactive strategic advice to the business, position itself as trusted advisors on technology issues, and help management improve returns on today’s unprecedented IT investments.

SYN’s Internal Technology Audit Solutions group was created specifically to help internal audit functions make the leap to this new paradigm. Led and driven by professionals with real-world IT IA experience and deep backgrounds in technology systems and risks, ITAS can deliver solutions and support to companies’ internal audit functions, including:

IT IA transformation planning, including mission, strategy, and organizational design
Strategic co-sourcing to augment specialized technical skills and deliver volume of required resources
Acting as change agents to drive innovation, change, and differentiation across internal audit
Strategic alignment with IT and business units for enhanced collaboration in managing risk
Leveraging technology and analytics in audit engagements and considering technology risks throughout the full internal audit plan
Focused risk coverage to align with company strategic plan, business imperatives, and relevant emerging topics
Integration of Cybersecurity & Emerging Technology, IT Governance & Service Delivery, Project Assurance, Business Applications, and other key existing SYN capabilities throughout the IA lifecycle to help IA functions elevate their performance and add increased value.
Digital disruption is here, and it’s not going away. To respond effectively, high performing IA functions need to fight fire with fire and bring truly disruptive, innovative solutions. We’re here to help.</p>
