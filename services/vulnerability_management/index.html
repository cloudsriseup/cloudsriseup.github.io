                    <p>Vulnerability management is a drain on your security team. Scans take too long, vulnerabilities detected are difficult to prioritize and new threat signatures are often not updated. This won't be an issue when you gain continuous visibility with our expertise.  Vulnerabilities within networks, web applications and databases emerge every day, caused by software defects and misconfigurations, opening the door to threat actors. Finding vulnerabilities relies on the accuracy of internal and external scan audits, both in on-premise and cloud environments. A managed security service provider staffed by certified security analysts removes the burden from your security team.<span class="widow-killer">We do not disappoint.</span></p>

                    <h2>Scanning</h2>
                    <p>Vulnerabilities emerge daily within networks, web applications and databases due to software defects or system misconfigurations. To avoid exploitation by threat actors, eliminating these exposures to protect your critical assets and information is essential.

SYN's vulnerability scanning service leverages tool-agnostic technologies to perform highly accurate internal and external scan audits across network devices, servers, web applications, databases and other assets in on-premise and cloud environments. Different service levels are available depending on your needs.

Achieve world-class vulnerability management without the hardware, software and maintenance requirements of most scanning products, in an on-demand service. The tool-agnostic technologies are fully managed and maintained by our dedicated vulnerability management team, eliminating administration and maintenance burdens so you can better focus on protecting your assets and reducing business risk.

Key Benefits:
Identify exploitable vulnerabilities: the largest knowledge base of vulnerability checks in the industry
Satisfy regulatory compliance requirements: a critical component for identifying information security risk
Dedicated team of experts: virtually eliminate false positives with expert operational support
Track remediation workflow: automated, integrated remediation and trouble-ticketing system

                    <h3>Threat Prioritization</h3>
                    <p>Top IT Security teams know that a best practice for vulnerability management is integrating internal vulnerability scanning with external threat feeds - ensuring that they're able to leverage real-world context when finding and remediating vulnerabilities.

This is easier said than done - there's no simple way to bring together scan data and threat intelligence, and doing so often requires hours of work in order to analyze, integrate and prioritize the data.

Our Vulnerability Threat Prioritization service correlates external Internet threat and exploit data with user vulnerability data to monitor, measure and prioritize vulnerability remediation across your environment. Results, including risk posture visualizations, are displayed within a dedicated business intelligence dashboard, as well as a consolidated, intelligent view of their scan, asset, patch, penetration and other data. The Vulnerability Threat Prioritization service is accessed through our Client Portal. 

Key Benefits:
Effective identification of threats: scans can be setup to run automatically or on demand
Asset prioritization: discover which threats are most severe and how to quickly resolve
Intelligence-driven defense: leverages applied SYN's Threat Intelligence team to stay ahead of the threat
Real-time view of risk: Risk Meters provide a consolidated view of threats in real time</p>
