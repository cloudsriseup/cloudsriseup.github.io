                    <h3>Approach</h3>
                    <p>SYN approaches every penetration test as unique to every organization. Our methodology is performed by the industry’s top security testers, leveraging our proprietary tactics and intelligence. Both Penetration and Advanced Penetration Tests are designed to show how an attacker would gain unauthorized access to your environment by compromising in-scope systems and highlight pivoting opportunities from compromised hosts. Based on the findings, SYN will discuss the findings with all relevant audiences and provide a customized course of action for both leadership and technical audiences.<span class="widow-killer">We do not disappoint.</span></p>

                    <h2>Proactive</h2>
                    <p>SYN’s penetration testing services are conducted on a low volume basis, with an average of only 10 clients per year. All of our pen testing assessments have a two week minimum engagement length, with the average engagement being four weeks long. Due to the low volume, high intensity nature of our pen testing engagements, there is often a significant lead-in time that is required for scheduling. We’ve designed our penetration testing services to simulate the activities of a malicious party in as accurate a manner as possible.

Penetration testing is not simply scanning for vulnerabilities and handing in a report. Quite simply: If all you are looking for is a checklist assessment, we are not the right company for you.

A penetration test will help companies determine the weaknesses in their network, computer systems and applications. A standard penetration test might contain a vulnerability assessment through conventional system and software testing or network security scanning alone. Unlike other penetration testing companies who focus on assembly line assessments, we take a different approach. At SYN, we deliver a quality product tailored to your needs. We work with our customers to build an accurate profile of what your primary business function is, where threats come from, and what the goal of your security assessment is. This is done to ensure that the work conducted meets your exact needs and not just easily productized. We focus on long term relationships with our clients to ensure they get the best penetration test possible, offering them high-end, professional security audit services tailored to their needs.

Because we only take on a single customer at a time, most of our penetration testing engagements are longer in length. Unfortunately, this means we can’t take on every customer. A good mutual match is an organization that is in either a high risk position or has reached a level of maturity where a traditional pen test is unable to deliver results.</p>

                    <h3>Is SYN right for you?</h3>
                    <p>If you need a penetration test, we want to talk with you. This is what you can expect:

When you contact us, we don’t have a sales person contact you. Instead, one of our team members will work with you to determine if we are a good mutual fit.
If we are, we will work out a schedule that works for everyone involved. If it so happens that we are not the right vendor for you, we will be upfront and not waste your time.
Rules of engagement will be set that meet the goals that you defined.
As work is conducted and we will be sure to keep you informed every step of the way. Our goal is no surprises on the report as you are kept involved on an on-going basis.
A report will be created that informs you as to what was discovered and what we suggest to correct any issues.
We will work with you to make sure you understand the results and have the knowledge needed to take any actions that you may need to take.
